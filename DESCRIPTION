Description: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's ECOS website contains a
    significant amount of information about species listed as threatened or
    endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (plus candidate and
    species petitioned for listing). But there is no way to download all of the
    documents, tables, and text on ECOS, thus hampering further analysis. This
    package provides tools and some data to enable scraping.
